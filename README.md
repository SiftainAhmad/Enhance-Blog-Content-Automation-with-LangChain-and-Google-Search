# Enhance-Blog-Content-Automation-with-LangChain-and-Google-Search

**Detailed step-by-step guide from start to finish for the project:**

1. **Project Setup and Environment Configuration:**
   - Set up your development environment with necessary Python libraries (`langchain`, `newspaper3k`, `deeplake`, `openai`, `tiktoken`, etc.).
   - Ensure environment variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, and `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` are properly configured for API access.

2. **Define Article Content and Text to Expand:**
   - Specify the title and full content of the article (`title`, `text_all`).
   - Identify a specific section of the text (`text_to_change`) that requires expansion using additional information.

3. **Generate Search Queries:**
   - Utilize ChatGPT (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`) to generate relevant search queries based on `text_to_change`.
   - Format these queries as bullet points (`- query1`, `- query2`, `- query3`) for use in the Google Search API.

4. **Retrieve Search Results:**
   - Implement a function to fetch top search results using Google Search API.
   - Store URLs of top results (`all_results`) for further content extraction.

5. **Extract Content from Web Pages:**
   - Use the `newspaper3k` library to parse and extract textual content from each URL in `all_results`.
   - Handle exceptions and edge cases like PDFs or restricted access sites gracefully.

6. **Split and Prepare Text Chunks:**
   - Employ a text splitting strategy (`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`) to break down extracted web content into manageable chunks (e.g., 3000 characters with 100-character overlap).
   - Create `Document` objects to store each chunk along with its metadata (e.g., source URL).

7. **Embedding Documents and Query:**
   - Utilize `OpenAIEmbeddings` to convert text chunks (`docs`) and the `text_to_change` into vector representations (`docs_embeddings`, `query_embedding`).
   - Calculate cosine similarities between `query_embedding` and `docs_embeddings` to determine relevance.

8. **Select Relevant Documents:**
   - Identify the top documents (`best_k_documents`) with the highest cosine similarity scores to `text_to_change`.
   - Ensure the selected documents provide diverse and relevant additional information.

9. **Formulate Prompt for AI Expansion:**
   - Construct a template (`template`) that integrates `title`, `text_all`, `text_to_change`, and selected `best_k_documents`.
   - Use `HumanMessagePromptTemplate` to format the prompt for the ChatGPT model, ensuring clarity and coherence.

10. **Execute Model to Expand Text:**
    - Instantiate a `ChatOpenAI` model (`gpt-3.5-turbo`) with a high-temperature setting (e.g., 0.9) to encourage creativity in text generation.
    - Create an `LLMChain` that connects the model with the formatted prompt (`chat_prompt_template`).
    - Execute the chain with inputs (`text_to_change`, `text_all`, `title`, `doc_1`, `doc_2`, `doc_3`) to expand and enrich `text_to_change`.

11. **Review and Validate Output:**
    - Evaluate the expanded text (`response`) generated by the model.
    - Ensure the output effectively integrates additional information from `best_k_documents` to enhance the original text.

12. **Document and Present Results:**
    - Document the entire workflow, including code snippets and results obtained.
    - Prepare a summary highlighting the project's objectives, methodologies, and outcomes for presentation or inclusion in a resume or portfolio.

13. **Iterate and Optimize (Optional):**
    - Optionally, refine the project by optimizing code efficiency, improving search query generation, or enhancing the model's prompt templates.
    - Consider feedback and potential improvements for future iterations or similar projects.

14. **Conclusion and Reflection:**
    - Reflect on the project's achievements, challenges faced, and lessons learned.
    - Summarize the impact of integrating external data sources via AI to enhance content creation and information retrieval capabilities.
